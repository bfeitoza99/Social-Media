# Social Media

This project simulates a social media using a backend built with .NET 8 and a frontend built with Angular.

## ðŸ”— How to Run the Project

### Using Docker

#### Prerequisites
- Ensure **Docker** is installed and running on your machine.

#### Steps
1. Navigate to the root directory of the project where the `docker-compose.yml` file is located.
2. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```sh
   docker-compose up -d
3. After the services are up, access the application:

- **Frontend**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Backend API**: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

##  Critique  

###  1. Lack of Unit Testing in the Frontend  
One of the key aspects missing in this project is **unit testing on the frontend**.  
- Unit tests are essential for validating individual components and ensuring that business logic works as expected.  
- Without them, the risk of regressions increases, making the application harder to maintain and scale as new features are added.  

###  2. Missing End-to-End (E2E) Tests  
If I had more time, I would implement **end-to-end (E2E) tests** for the frontend to ensure better stability and feature validation.  
- E2E tests provide a **higher level of confidence** in the applicationâ€™s functionality by simulating real user interactions across different workflows.  
- This would help detect potential **integration issues** between the frontend and backend, ensuring a **more stable and reliable system**.  

###  3. Scalability and Kubernetes for Production Deployment  
From a **scalability perspective**, the current setup could be improved by implementing a **Kubernetes cluster** for **horizontal scaling**.  
Right now, the project relies on **Docker Compose**, which is ideal for **local development and small-scale deployments**. However, for a **production-grade environment** handling increased traffic and load, transitioning to **Kubernetes** would offer:  

**Automatic scaling** based on resource usage.  
**Better load balancing** to distribute requests efficiently.  
**Self-healing capabilities**, where failed containers are restarted automatically.  
**Improved deployment strategies**, such as rolling updates and blue-green deployments.  

### 4. Benefits of These Improvements  
By incorporating **unit tests, E2E tests, and a Kubernetes-based infrastructure**, the project would benefit from:  

**Higher reliability** through automated testing and reduced risk of regressions.  
**Improved scalability** by efficiently handling increased workloads.  
**Better maintainability** with a structured **CI/CD pipeline**, ensuring smooth deployments.  

### Final Thoughts  
Implementing these improvements would make the system more **robust, scalable, and production-ready**, allowing it to support a **growing number of users** with minimal downtime and operational overhead. ðŸš€
